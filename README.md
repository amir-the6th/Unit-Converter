# Unit Conversion App

- This is my solution to a solo project in Scrimba [JavaScript course](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnjavascript).
- This app offers a simple solution to the problem of converting length, volume, and mass units from metric to imperial or vice versa.
- Just type the number you want to convert, and the app will show all of the conversions at once. 
- I built this project from scratch and added more functionalities than what was asked such as responsiveness and different UI for desktop and mobile. 
- Hope you like it! üôåüèº

- Pure CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

The only difficult part of this challenge was adding responsiveness. 

I struggled to set the width of the columns to 100% on tablets and mobiles. 

During learning how to fix this, I learned about these definitions:
- `flex-grow`
- `flex-shrink`
- `flex-basis`
- `width: max-content`

Overall, I enjoyed my time working on this project. CSS can become quite challenging, but when learned the right way, any challenge can be tackled easily.
